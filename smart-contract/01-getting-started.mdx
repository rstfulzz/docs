# Getting Started with Move

Learn to write smart contracts on Sui using the Move programming language.

## What is Move?

Move is a safe and flexible programming language designed for blockchain smart contracts. Originally developed for the Diem blockchain, Move has been adapted for Sui with unique features that leverage Sui's object-centric architecture.

## Why Move for Sui?

Move is perfectly suited for Sui's object-centric model:

- **Objects as First-Class Citizens** - Everything in Sui is an object with ownership
- **Parallel Execution** - Move's ownership model enables safe parallel transaction processing
- **Rich Type System** - Define complex on-chain data structures with ease
- **Security by Design** - Prevent common vulnerabilities like reentrancy and integer overflow
