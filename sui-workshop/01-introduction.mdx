# Welcome to the Sui Frontend Workshop

This workshop will guide you through building a decentralized application (dApp) frontend on the Sui blockchain using **@mysten/dapp-kit**, the official React SDK from Mysten Labs.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

1. **Install and configure** the Sui TypeScript SDK and dApp Kit
2. **Set up providers** for connecting to the Sui blockchain
3. **Connect wallets** using pre-built UI components
4. **Read blockchain data** using React hooks
5. **Sign and execute transactions** from your React application

## Prerequisites

Before starting this workshop, you should have:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) and **npm** or **pnpm** installed
- Basic knowledge of **React** and **TypeScript**
- Familiarity with **React Hooks** and context providers
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## What is Sui?

Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain designed for high performance and low latency. It uses the Move programming language and provides a unique object-centric data model.

## What is dApp Kit?

The **@mysten/dapp-kit** is a collection of React hooks, components, and utilities that make it easy to:

- Connect to Sui wallets (Sui Wallet, Suiet, Ethos, etc.)
- Query blockchain data with type-safe React hooks
- Build and sign transactions
- Manage wallet state and network configuration
