# Welcome to Sui Blockchain Development 🌊

Sui is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain designed for instant transaction finality, high throughput, and low latency. Built by Mysten Labs, Sui introduces revolutionary concepts that make it ideal for building decentralized applications.

## What is Sui?

Sui is a **permissionless** Layer 1 blockchain that redefines asset ownership and programmability. Unlike traditional blockchains, Sui uses an **object-centric** data model where everything is an object, making it more intuitive and efficient for developers.

### Key Features

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

1. **Install and configure** the Sui TypeScript SDK and dApp Kit
2. **Set up providers** for connecting to the Sui blockchain
3. **Connect wallets** using pre-built UI components
4. **Read blockchain data** using React hooks
5. **Sign and execute transactions** from your React application

## Prerequisites

Before starting this workshop, you should have:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) and **npm** or **pnpm** installed
- Basic knowledge of **React** and **TypeScript**
- Familiarity with **React Hooks** and context providers
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Sui Development Stack

This workshop covers the complete Sui development stack:

### Frontend Development

Build user interfaces that interact with the Sui blockchain using:

- **React** - Modern UI framework
- **@mysten/dapp-kit** - Official Sui React SDK
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **@tanstack/react-query** - Data fetching and caching

### Smart Contract Development

Write on-chain logic using:

- **Move** - Sui's smart contract language
- **Sui CLI** - Command-line tools for development
- **Sui Framework** - Standard library and utilities
- **Testing Tools** - Unit and integration testing

## Why Build on Sui?

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="🚀 High Performance">
Sui can process **thousands of transactions per second** with sub-second finality. The parallel execution model means your dApp won't be slowed down by network congestion.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="💰 Low Cost">
  Gas fees on Sui are **extremely low** and **predictable**, making it
  economical to build applications with frequent on-chain interactions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔒 Secure by Design">
  Move's type system and ownership model prevent common smart contract
  vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks and integer overflows.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="👨‍💻 Developer Friendly">
Comprehensive documentation, robust tooling, and an active community make it easy to get started and get help when needed.
</Accordion>
